# bashrc-jmoore

## Getting started

Clone this repo in your home directory and run the bash-setup.sh script to add the required loading args to the bashrc.

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/jkwmoore/bashrc-jmoore.git
cd bashrc-jmoore
. bash-setup.sh
```

Then review and enable within ``.bashrc`` after checking for the "Git pull + SSH agent forwarding causes high CPU" bug.
